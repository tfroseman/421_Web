        <h2 class="heading">Objective</h2>
        <p>
        The goal of the course is to introduce students to the most significant and exciting computing paradigm--net-centric computing and service-oriented computing, which is expected to have an impact on all aspects of software construction at least as wide as that of object-oriented paradigm. This is a wide area and it is ever-evolving. We focus on the following aspects
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">On the client</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript to develop the client side of Rich Web Applications. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">client-server-communication</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn Ajax. We will also learn how JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) can sometimes be used as a viable alternative to XML for server to client data transmission.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">On the server</h2>
        <p>
            We will learn about a variety of server-side technologies, especially focusing on the node framework and simple RESTful web services.
